1. Person
   Write a class that represents a personal record. It has the following properties, all set from the constructor:

   - firstName
   - lastName
   - age
   - email
     And a method toString(), which prints a summary of the information. See the example for formatting details.
     Input
     The constructor function will receive valid parameters.
     Output
     The toString()method should return a string in the following format:
     `{firstName} {lastName} (age: {age}, email: {email})`
     Submit the class definition as is, without wrapping it in any function.

2. Get Persons
   Write a function that returns an array of Person objects. Use the class from the previous task, create the following
   instances, and return them in an array.

3. Circle
   Write a class that represents a Circle. It has only one data property - its radius, and it is set through the
   constructor. The class needs to have getter and setter methods for its diameter - the setter needs to calculate
   the radius and change it and the getter needs to use the radius to calculate the diameter and return it.
   The circle also has a getter area(), which calculates and returns its area.
   Input
   The constructor function and diameter setter will receive valid parameters.
   Output
   The diameter() and area() getters should return numbers.
   Submit the class definition as is, without wrapping it in any function.
